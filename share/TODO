 Instaed of cpanm -L, cpanm --testonly then cpanm --install -f ?
 Or is -l enough anyway since you don't care if it's already installed in
 system perl? What if you want to use an old dir and test against current?
 Perhaps let someone specify since the benefit of -L is all deps (non-core)
 will be installed which makes it a self-contained place to run tests in the
 future even if you've updated things on your system..
